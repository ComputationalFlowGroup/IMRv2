## WELCOME TO Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry solver for Non-Newtonian flows

### This repository of the code is managed by the Rodriguez Flow Research Group @ Brown University
### Developer(s): 
1. Mauro Rodriguez (PI), mauro_rodriguez@brown.edu
2. Eric Hersey, ehersey@umich.edu

### The main code is in the /src directory, the spectral collocation method version of the code is in the /src_spec directory

### To do
0. Improve commenting throughout the code
1. KM with enthalpy 
2. Improve out-of-equilibrium collapse conditions
3. Improve elastic forces calculation
4. Add viscoelasticity from Warnez portions of the codes
