## WELCOME TO THE KELLER-MIKSIS SOLVER 

### This portion of the code is managed by the Rodriguez Flow Research Group @ Brown University
### Developer(s): 
1. Mauro Rodriguez (PI), mauro_rodriguez@brown.edu
2. Eric Hersey, ehersey@umich.edu

### The main code is in the /src directory, the spectral collocation method version of the code is in the /src_spec directory

### To do
0. Improve commenting throughout the code
1. Fix integration term for the non-Newtoninan terms
2. KM with enthalpy 
3. Improve out-of-equilibrium collapse conditions
4. Improve elastic forces calculation
5. Add capability to load a pressure field from data
6. Make finite difference matrices sparse to speed up calculation
