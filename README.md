# Welcome to IMRv2

IMRv2 is an advanced computational tool for **Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR)**, enabling the characterization of soft materials under high strain-rate conditions. IMR correlates the evolution of bubble pressure and stress fields in a material with kinematic observations obtained from high-speed videography.

IMRv2 originated from the **Computational Flow Group at Brown University** and is now actively developed by researchers at multiple institutions:
- [Christian Franck](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/Faculty/Franck_Christian/) (University of Wisconsin-Madison)
- [David Henann](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/dhenann) (Brown University)
- [Eric Johnsen](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/eric-johnsen/) (University of Michigan)
- [Jon Estrada](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/jon-estrada/) (University of Michigan)
- [Mauro Rodriguez](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97) (Brown University) - **Lead Developer**
- [Spencer Bryngelson](https://comp-physics.group/) (Georgia Tech)
- [Jin Yang](https://sites.utexas.edu/yang) (University of Texas at Austin)

For questions, contact [Mauro Rodriguez](mailto:mrodri97@brown.edu) or request to join the IMR Slack workspace.

## Features

IMRv2 offers several key capabilities for modeling and analyzing inertial microcavitation:

- **Bubble Dynamics Simulation**: Implements both finite difference and spectral methods for discretizing partial differential equations, as detailed in:
  - Estrada et al., "High Strain-rate Soft Material Characterization via Inertial Cavitation," [Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2017.12.006).
  - Warnez and Johnsen, "Numerical modeling of bubble dynamics in viscoelastic media with relaxation," [Physics of Fluids, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4928860).
- **High Strain-rate Characterization**: Analyzes high-speed video data to extract material properties under dynamic loading.
- **MATLAB Integration**: Provides scripts and functions for simulation control, data analysis, and visualization.
- **Experimental Validation Support**: Facilitates comparison between simulation results and experimental observations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

IMRv2 is implemented in **MATLAB** and requires the following dependencies:

- MATLAB (version R2021a or newer recommended)
- Optimization Toolbox (optional but recommended for parameter fitting)
- Image Processing Toolbox (for analyzing high-speed video data)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the IMRv2 directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InertialMicrocavitationRheometry/IMRv2.git
cd IMRv2
```

Add IMRv2 to your MATLAB path:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('IMRv2'))
savepath
```

### Running an Example

To run a basic simulation of bubble dynamics, execute the following command in MATLAB:

```matlab
run_example.m
```

For additional examples, see the `examples/` directory.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation, including a user guide, can be found in the `docs/` folder and on the IMRv2 website.
